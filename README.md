# LeetCode â€“ Top Interview Questions (Easy Collection)

## ðŸ“Œ About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions to **LeetCode's Top Interview Questions â€“ Easy Collection**. It is part of LeetCodeâ€™s official curated list aimed at helping candidates master **Data Structures & Algorithms** and improve their coding skills.

Iâ€™m currently solving problems from the **Easy Collection**, which includes:

- âœ… Array  
- âœ… Strings  
- âœ… Linked List  
- âœ… Trees  
- âœ… Sorting and Searching  
- âœ… Dynamic Programming  
- âœ… Design  
- âœ… Math  
- âœ… Others

## ðŸ§  Goal & Learning Approach

The purpose of this repo is to **practice deliberately** for coding interviews. I'm not just solving problems once â€” I revisit them to improve and optimize my code over time.

> _"Deliberate practice does not mean memorizing solutions. The more you solve problems yourself without referring to answers, the better you'll become."_
